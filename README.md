# vpmframe-slimwp

An unholy merger of WordPress and Slim framework.

Loads the WordPress framework in a middleware (app/Middlewares/WpMiddleware:load), and displays WordPress when a Slim route is not found.

Allows you to run a standard WordPress site, then load in Slim in select situations/routes, while maintaining access to the full Slim API.
